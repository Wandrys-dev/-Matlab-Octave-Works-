% Arithmetic Operators in Octave

% Octave allows user to perform arithmetic operations using following arithmetic operators:

% + Addition
% - Subtraction
% * Multiplication
% / Division
% ^ Exponent

% Octave also allows user to use the letter 'e' for scientific notation
% Example: 5100000 can be expressed as 5.1e6 

% Order of Operations
% Octave uses the same rules as algebra when executing operations
% Order- Parentheses>Exponents>Multiplication&Division>Addition&Subtraction
