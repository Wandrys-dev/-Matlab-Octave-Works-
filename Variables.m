% Variables in Octave
% Variable is a location in the memory which stores the value.
% Octave allows user to store Numerical,Character and Logical Data in Variables.

% Variables are created when we assign a value to the variable using Equals(=) sign.
% Example
b = 5;
% b stores a integer value 5.
% Semicolon ; tells octave interpreter to not print the statement.
% To display the value of variable, simply type the name of the variable.
% For above example :
 b
 
 % Variable Assignments
 
 % Numerical Data
 
 a = 2

 % Both Single and Double quotes can be used for String assignment.
